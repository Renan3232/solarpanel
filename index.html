                <p>"People thinking about going solar, they need to think about how energy is going to increase in the coming years and once I pay off this system, that’s it. I’ll just be paying the minimum on my electricity."</p>
                <p>"We’re actually saving about $150 a month on our light bill from what it used to be. And it was shocking to see one month our bill was only $10. Even in the heat of the summer, it got up to about $45."</p>
                <p>"It’s been a really good experience, It’s nice to have an energy specialist who is knowledgeable and always available if we have questions or need help with anything"</p>
